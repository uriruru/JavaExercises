Choose an odd number between 50 and 100 and save it as an int variable telling us how many Lego bricks we have (e.g. amountOfBricks ), 
then select an even number between 5 and 10 stating how many Lego blocks fit in one container (e.g.: containerCapacity ) and save it as an int variable as well.

Write a program that will calculate how many full containers we have, how many containers, in general, are full and not full, and how many blocks 
are in the container that is not completely full (use the modulo operator for this)




import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("How many Lego bricks do we have? Choose an odd number between 50 and 100: ");
    int amountOfBricks = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());

    System.out.println("How many Lego blocks fit in one container? Choose an even number between 5 and 10: ");
    int containerCapacity = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());

    int noOfFullContainers = amountOfBricks/containerCapacity;
    int noOfTotalContainers;

    int noOfBlocksInNotFullContainers = amountOfBricks%containerCapacity;

    if(noOfBlocksInNotFullContainers!=0){
      noOfTotalContainers = noOfFullContainers + 1;
    }else{
      noOfTotalContainers = noOfFullContainers;
    }
    
    System.out.println("No of full containers we have: "+noOfFullContainers);
    System.out.println("No of total containers we have: "+noOfTotalContainers);
    System.out.println("No of blocks in the container that is not completely full: "+noOfBlocksInNotFullContainers);
        
  }
}
