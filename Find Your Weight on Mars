Mars’ gravity is about 38% of Earth’s. Write a program that will calculate your weight on Mars.

Declare all variables at the top of the class.
Initial variables are to be of float type.
After making the calculations, assign the result to a new variable, this time of the double type.
After assigning the assignment, write the variable double to the console, limiting its length to 4 decimal places.
Cast the above variable of double type to a new variable of int type.
Cast the above variable of type int to a new variable of type char.
Do any math operation on this variable char type and assign the value of this activity to the new variable int type.
Each of the above actions should be written to the console, adding some text explaining what has been done.





import java.util.Scanner;  

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("How many pounds (lbs) do you weigh? ") ;
  float weight = input.nextFloat();

  // computing the weight on mars
  double weightOnMars = (weight * .38);

  // displaying results with 4 decimal places
  System.out.println("Your weight is "+String.format("%.4f",weightOnMars)+" lbs on Mars");

    System.out.println("Converting the variable into integer");
    int weightOnMarsInt = (int)weightOnMars;
    System.out.println(weightOnMarsInt);

    System.out.println("Converting the variable into char");
    char weightOnMarsChar = (char)weightOnMars;
    System.out.println(weightOnMarsChar);

    System.out.println("Converting the variable into Int and doing an operation on it");
    int newIntVariable = weightOnMarsChar * 2;
    System.out.println(newIntVariable);
    
  }
}
